# Yummy Decisions
Yummy Decisions is a restaurant organizer. The user can add new restaurants to their list with the following properties:
Name, Cuisine, Photo, Favorite Dish, Notes, Price Level, and whether or not they have visited or not. 
The restaurants are then sorted into two lists - visited or not.

## Stretch Goals:
- User login/logout feature - saves their lists 
- Pull from a 3rd party API - Cloudinary
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap - using Bootstrap for my modals

## Future Goals:
- react router 
- add another model - takeout menus
- clean up design
- Yelp for Restaurant Search
